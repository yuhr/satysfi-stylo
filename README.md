# satysfi-stylo

Stylo is a satysfactory graphics library for [SATySFi](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi) which focuses on drawing geometrical diagrams in its entirety. Rendered diagrams are meant to be comparable to Xy-pic package of LaTeX, but the code looks readable and descriptive.

Heavy development ongoing. Stay tuned.

See examples in [the documentation](./docs/stylo.pdf).
